# Regular Expression

- Regular expressions use the backslash character (`'\'`) to indicate special forms or to allow special characters to be used without invoking their special meaning. 


### Python raw string

- Use Python's raw string notation for regular expression patterns; backlashes are not handled in any special way in a string literal prefixed with `'r'`.
- So `r"\n"` is a two-character string containing `'\'` and `'n'`, while `"\n"` is a one-character string containing a newline. 
- Usually patterns will be expressed in PYthon code using the raw string notation.
